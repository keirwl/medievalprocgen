As a worldbuilding-obsessed teenager, I discovered S. John Ross's "Medieval Demographics Made Easy" [1] which explains how to create "realistic" population numbers for medieval European fantasy countries and cities using dice rolls.
As a beginning programmer in my early 20s I wrote a Python script to simulate fantasy countries using its methods.
As a more-experienced programmer in my late 20s, I'm trying to expand the idea to experiment with procedural generation.
Eventually I want it to be a dynamic simulation of the economics of a medieval European fantasy kingdom, loosely based on those of Mount & Blade. [2]
